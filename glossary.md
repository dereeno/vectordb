"origin": The origin of replication in the vector.
"inserts" : The fragments of DNA inserted into the backbone to make the overall vector.
"growth_notes": Notes for the scientist on how to duplicate this vector in the laboratory.
"terms": Keyword search terms.
"resistance_markers": A key attribute of the vector that describes how to work with it in the laboratory.
"name": The name given to the vector.
"tags": More search tags for this vector.
"url": The URL were this vector can be viewed on addgene.org.
"growth_temp": The temperature to cultivate cells containing this vector.
"public_addgene_partial_sequences": One or more fragments of the experimentally verified DNA sequence of the vector.
"id": The ID of this vector. Should be unique within the collection but this is not guaranteed.
"public_user_partial_sequences": Fragments of the Vector's DNA sequence supplied by the scientist contributing it to the collection.
"cloning": Semi-structed data on how this vector was produced.
"public_user_full_sequences": The full sequence the vector should have as supplied by the PI. Not independently verified.
"sequences": A collection of sequences associated with this vector.
"article": The publication describing how this vector was constructed and how it may be used in the lab.
"plasmid_copy": The number of copies of this vector found in each cell.
"pi": The Primary Investigator of the lab contributing this vector to the collection.
"growth_strain": The cell type used to host this vector.
"public_addgene_full_sequences": The full sequence of the vector as verified by Addgene.
"bacterial_resistance": Same as resistance_markers except for bacterial cells.
"vector": Each element of this collection is a vector - a self-replicating molecule of DNA used to clone (copy) interesting sequences and move the sequences between cells. Vectors are like USB thumb drives for cells and their sequence is the bytes stored within them.
